  <p className="w-8/12 mt-4 ">Your brand is present in a huge range of digital and real-world locations. But global collaboration presents several challenges: When different people, tools and systems come together, the results can be unpredictable. Quality becomes unreliable, processes slow down and things often get needlessly complicated. File sharing costs your employees time and patience they have to wait for the right files because instead of accessing materials whenever they need them. Working like this is particularly frustrating when your teams are based in different time zones - and can lead to expensive delays.
Disorganization, lack of transparency or an insufficient overview of progress can make it more difficult to maintain control over your brand identity. And because every employee has different skills and abilities, this can lead to a real problem.</p>
